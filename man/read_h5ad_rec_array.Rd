\details{
A "record array" (recarray) is a Python NumPy array type that contains
"fields" that can be indexed using attributes (similar to columns in a
spreadsheet). See https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.recarray.html
for details.

They are used by \strong{scanpy} to score marker gene testing results.
